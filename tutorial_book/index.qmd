Welcome to the [MICrONs-Explorer](https://www.microns-explorer.org/) data ecosystem.

The MICrONS open-access dataset is a  functional connectome containing __200,000 cells, 75,000 neurons with physiology, and 523 million synapses.__

This resource provides interactive visualizations of anatomical and functional data that span all 6 layers of mouse primary visual cortex and 3 higher visual areas (LM, AL, RL) within a cubic millimeter volume.

__Highlights:__
