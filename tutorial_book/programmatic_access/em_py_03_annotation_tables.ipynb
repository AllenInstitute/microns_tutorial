    "# Annotation Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "The `minnie65_public` data release includes a number of annotation tables that help label the dataset.\n",
    "This section describes the content of each of these tables — [see here for instructions for how to query and filter tables](em:query-tables).\n",
    "Unless otherwise specificied (i.e. via `desired_resolution`), all positions are in units of 4,4,40 nm/voxel resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Several fields (or column names) are common to many tables.\n",
    "These fall into two main classes: the spatial point columns that are how we assign annotations to cells via points in the 3d space and book-keeping columns, that are used internally to track the state of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Point Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tables have one or more **Bound Spatial Points**, which is a location in the 3d space that tells the annotation to remain associated with the root id at that location.\n",
    "Bound spatial points have will have one prefix, usually `pt` (i.e. \"point\") and three associated columns with different suffixes: `_position`, `_supervoxel_id`, and `_root_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given prefix `{pt}`, the three columns are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `{pt}_position` indicates the location of the point in 3d space.\n",
    "* The `{pt}_supervoxel_id` indicates a unique identifier in the segmentation, and is mostly internal bookkeeping.\n",
    "* The `{pt}_root_id` indicates the root id of the annotation at that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Book-keeping Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Several columns are common to many or all tables, and mostly used as internal book-keeping.\n",
    "Rather than describe these for every table, they will just be mentioned briefly here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{list-table}\n",
    ":header-rows: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "* - Column\n",
    "  - Description\n",
    "* - `id`\n",
    "  - A unique ID specific to the annotation within that table.\n",
    "* - `created`\n",
    "  - The date that the annotation was created.\n",
    "* - `valid`\n",
    "  - Internal bookkeeping column, should always be `t` for data you can download.\n",
    "* - `target_id` (optional)\n",
    "  - Some tables reference other tables, particularly the nucleus table. If present, this column will be the same as `id`.\n",
    "* - `created_ref` / `valid_ref` / `id_ref` (optional)\n",
    "  - For reference tables, the data shows both the created/valid/id of the reference annotation and the target annotation. The values with the `_ref` suffix are those of the reference table (usually something like proofreading state or cell type) and the values without a suffix ar ethose of the target table (usually a nucleus). \n",

    "## Synapse Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Table name: `synapses_pni_v2`\n",
    "\n",
    "The only synapse table is `synapses_pni_v2`. This is by far the largest table in the dataset with 337 million entries, one for each synapse.\n",
    "It contains the following columns (in addition to the bookkeeping columns):\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} Column Definitions\n",
    "```{list-table}\n",
    ":header-rows: 1\n",

    "  - Description\n",
    "* - `pre_pt_position` / `pre_pt_supervoxel_id` / `pre_pt_root_id`\n",
    "  - The bound spatial point data for the presynaptic side of the synapse.\n",
    "* - `post_pt_position` / `post_pt_supervoxel_id` / `post_pt_root_id`\n",
    "  - The bound spatial point data for the postsynaptic side of the synapse.\n",
    "* - `size`\n",
    "  - The size of the synapse in voxels. This correlates well, but not perfectly, with the surface area of synapse.\n",
    "* - `ctr_pt_position`\n",
    "  - A position in the center of the detected synaptic junction. Of all points in the synapse table, this is usually the closest point to the surface (and thus mesh) of both neurons. Because it is at the edge of cells, it is not associated with a root id.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nucleus Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Table name: `nucleus_ref_neuron_svm`\n",
    "\n",
    "Nucleus detection has been used to define unique cells in the dataset.\n",
    "Distinct from the neuronal segmentation, a convolutional neural network was trained to segment nuclei.\n",
    "Each nucleus detection was given a unique ID, and the centroid of the nucleus was recorded as well as its volume.\n",
    "While the table of centroids for all nuclei is `nucleus_detection_v0`, this includes neuronal nuclei, non-neuronal nuclei, and some erroneous detections.\n",
    "The table `nucleus_ref_neuron_svm` shows the results of a classifier that was trained to distinguish neuronal nuclei from non-neuronal nuclei and errors.\n",
    "For the purposes of analysis, we recommend using the `nucleus_ref_neuron_svm` table to get the most broad collection of neurons in the dataset.\n",

    "Because each method requires a different kind of information, not all cells are present in all tables.\n",
