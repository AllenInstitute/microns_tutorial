    "## Interface Basics\n",
    "The Neuroglancer interface is divided into panels.\n",
    "In the default view, one panel shows the imagery in the X/Y plane (left), one shows a 3d view centered at the same location, and the narrow third panel provides information about the specific layer.\n",
    "Note that at the center of the each panel is a collection of axis-aligned red, blue and, green lines. The intersection and direction of each of these lines is consistent across all panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the top left of the view, you can see tabs with different names.\n",
    "Neuroglancer organizes data into *layers*, where each layer tells Neuroglancer about a different aspect of the data.\n",
    "The default view has three layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `img` describes how to render imagery.\n",
    "* `seg` describes how to render segmentation and meshes.\n",
    "* `ann` is a manual annotation layer, allowing the user to add annotations to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can switch between layers by *right clicking* on the layer tab.\n",
    "You will see the panel at the right change to provide controls for each layer as you click it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of all layers, the user view, and all annotations is stored as a JSON object called the **state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic controls for navigation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `single click/drag` slides the imagery in X/Y and rotates the 3d view.\n",
    "* `scroll wheel up/down` moves the imagery in Z.\n",
    "* `right click` jumps the 3d view to the clicked location in either the imagery or on a segmented object.\n",
    "* `double click` selects a segmentation and loads its mesh into the 3d view. Double clicking on a selected neuron deselects it.\n",
    "* `control-scrool` zooms the view under the cursor in or out.\n",
    "* `z` snaps the view to the closest right angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can paste a position into Neuroglancer by clicking the x, y, z coordinate in the upper left corner and pasting a space or comma-separated list of numbers and hitting enter.\n",
    "Note that Neuroglancer always works in voxel units, and you can see the resolution of the voxels in the extreme upper left corner."

    "\n",
