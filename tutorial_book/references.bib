	abstract = {To understand the brain we must relate neurons' functional responses to the circuit architecture that shapes them. Here, we present a large functional connectomics dataset with dense calcium imaging of a millimeter scale volume. We recorded activity from approximately 75,000 neurons in primary visual cortex ({VISp}) and three higher visual areas ({VISrl}, {VISal} and {VISlm}) in an awake mouse viewing natural movies and synthetic stimuli. The functional data were co-registered with a volumetric electron microscopy ({EM}) reconstruction containing more than 200,000 cells and 0.5 billion synapses. Subsequent proofreading of a subset of neurons in this volume yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections that map up to thousands of cell-to-cell connections per neuron. Here, we release this dataset as an open-access resource to the scientific community including a set of tools that facilitate data retrieval and downstream analysis. In accompanying papers we describe our findings using the dataset to provide a comprehensive structural characterization of cortical cell types1–3 and the most detailed synaptic level connectivity diagram of a cortical column to date2, uncovering unique cell-type specific inhibitory motifs that can be linked to gene expression data4. Functionally, we identify new computational principles of how information is integrated across visual space5, characterize novel types of neuronal invariances6 and bring structure and function together to decipher a general principle that wires excitatory neurons within and across areas7,8.},

            Maps of the nervous system that identify individual cells along with their type, subcellular components and connectivity have the potential to elucidate fundamental organizational principles of neural circuits. Nanometer-resolution imaging of brain tissue provides the necessary raw data, but inferring cellular and subcellular annotation layers is challenging. We present segmentation-guided contrastive learning of representations ({SegCLR}), a self-supervised machine learning technique that produces representations of cells directly from 3D imagery and segmentations. When applied to volumes of human and mouse cortex, {SegCLR} enables accurate classification of cellular subcompartments and achieves performance equivalent to a supervised approach while requiring 400-fold fewer labeled examples. {SegCLR} also enables inference of cell types from fragments as small as 10 μm, which enhances the utility of volumes in which many neurites are truncated at boundaries. Finally, {SegCLR} enables exploration of layer 5 pyramidal cell subtypes and automated large-scale analysis of synaptic partners in mouse visual cortex.},

	abstract = {Learning from experience depends at least in part on changes in neuronal connections. We present the largest map of connectivity to date between cortical neurons of a defined type (layer 2/3 [L2/3] pyramidal cells in mouse primary visual cortex), which was enabled by automated analysis of serial section electron microscopy images with improved handling of image defects (250 × 140 × 90 μm3 volume). We used the map to identify constraints on the learning algorithms employed by the cortex. Previous cortical studies modeled a continuum of synapse sizes by a log-n­ ormal distribution. A continuum is consistent with most neural network models of learning, in which synaptic strength is a continuously graded analog variable. Here, we show that synapse size, when restricted to synapses between L2/3 pyramidal cells, is well modeled by the sum of a binary variable and an analog variable drawn from a log-­normal distribution. Two synapses sharing the same presynaptic and postsynaptic cells are known to be correlated in size. We show that the binary variables of the two synapses are highly correlated, while the analog variables are not. Binary variation could be the outcome of a Hebbian or other synaptic plasticity rule depending on activity signals that are relatively uniform across neuronal arbors, while analog variation may be dominated by other influences such as spontaneous dynamical fluctuations. We discuss the implications for the longstanding hypothesis that activity-­dependent plasticity switches synapses between bistable states.},

	abstract = {A defining characteristic of intelligent systems, whether natural or artificial, is the ability to generalize and infer behaviorally relevant latent causes from high-dimensional sensory input, despite significant variations in the environment. To understand how brains achieve generalization, it is crucial to identify the features to which neurons respond selectively and invariantly. However, the high-dimensional nature of visual inputs, the non-linearity of information processing in the brain, and limited experimental time make it challenging to systematically characterize neuronal tuning and invariances, especially for natural stimuli. Here, we extended “inception loops” — a paradigm that iterates between large-scale recordings, neural predictive models, and
            in silico
            experiments followed by
            in vivo
            verification — to systematically characterize single neuron invariances in the mouse primary visual cortex. Using the predictive model we synthesized Diverse Exciting Inputs ({DEIs}), a set of inputs that differ substantially from each other while each driving a target neuron strongly, and verified these {DEIs}’ efficacy
            in vivo
            . We discovered a novel bipartite invariance: one portion of the receptive field encoded phase-invariant texturelike patterns, while the other portion encoded a fixed spatial pattern. Our analysis revealed that the division between the fixed and invariant portions of the receptive fields aligns with object boundaries defined by spatial frequency differences present in highly activating natural images. These findings suggest that bipartite invariance might play a role in segmentation by detecting texture-defined object boundaries, independent of the phase of the texture. We also replicated these bipartite {DEIs} in the functional connectomics {MICrONs} data set, which opens the way towards a circuit-level mechanistic understanding of this novel type of invariance. Our study demonstrates the power of using a data-driven deep learning approach to systematically characterize neuronal invariances. By applying this method across the visual hierarchy, cell types, and sensory modalities, we can decipher how latent variables are robustly extracted from natural scenes, leading to a deeper understanding of generalization.},

	abstract = {Vision is fundamentally context-dependent, with neuronal responses influenced not just by local features but also by surrounding contextual information. In the visual cortex, studies using simple grating stimuli indicate that congruent stimuli - where the center and surround share the same orientation - are more inhibitory than when orientations are orthogonal, potentially serving redundancy reduction and predictive coding. Understanding these center-surround interactions in relation to natural image statistics is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the stimulus space, yet crucial for deciphering the neuronal code of real-world sensory processing. Utilizing large-scale recordings from mouse V1, we trained convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) to predict and synthesize surround patterns that either optimally suppressed or enhanced responses to center stimuli, confirmed by in vivo experiments. Contrary to the notion that congruent stimuli are suppressive, we found that surrounds that completed patterns based on natural image statistics were facilitatory, while disruptive surrounds were suppressive. Applying our {CNN} image synthesis method in macaque V1, we discovered that pattern completion within the near surround occurred more frequently with excitatory than with inhibitory surrounds, suggesting that our results in mice are conserved in macaques. Further, experiments and model analyses confirmed previous studies reporting the opposite effect with grating stimuli in both species. Using the {MICrONS} functional connectomics dataset, we observed that neurons with similar feature selectivity formed excitatory connections regardless of their receptive field overlap, aligning with the pattern completion phenomenon observed for excitatory surrounds. Finally, our empirical results emerged in a normative model of perception implementing Bayesian inference, where neuronal responses are modulated by prior knowledge of natural scene statistics. In summary, our findings identify a novel relationship between contextual information and natural scene statistics and provide evidence for a role of contextual modulation in hierarchical inference},

	abstract = {In primates and most carnivores, neurons in primary visual cortex are spatially organized by their functional properties. For example, neurons with similar orientation preferences are grouped together in iso-orientation domains that smoothly vary over the cortical sheet. In rodents, on the other hand, neurons with different orientation preferences are thought to be spatially intermingled, a feature which has been termed “salt-and-pepper” organization. The apparent absence of any systematic structure in orientation tuning has been considered a defining feature of the rodent visual system for more than a decade, with broad implications for brain development, visual processing, and comparative neurophysiology. Here, we revisited this question using new techniques for wide-field two-photon calcium imaging that enabled us to collect nearly complete population tuning preferences in layers 2-4 across a large fraction of the mouse visual hierarchy. Examining the orientation tuning of these hundreds of thousands of neurons, we found a global map spanning multiple visual cortical areas in which orientation bias was organized around a single pinwheel centered in V1. This pattern was consistent across animals and cortical depth. The existence of this global organization in rodents has implications for our understanding of visual processing and the principles governing the ontogeny and phylogeny of the visual cortex of mammals.},

The emergence of foundation models, trained on vast datasets, has introduced a new {AI} paradigm with remarkable generalization capabilities. We collected large amounts of neural activity from visual cortices of multiple mice and trained a foundation model to accurately predict neuronal responses to arbitrary natural videos. This model generalized to new mice with minimal training and successfully predicted responses across various new stimulus domains, such as coherent motion and noise patterns. It could also be adapted to new tasks beyond neural prediction, accurately predicting anatomical cell types, dendritic features, and neuronal connectivity within the {MICrONS} functional connectomics dataset.

Contrary to previous classiﬁcations into discrete morphological types (m-types), our data-driven approach suggests that the morphological landscape of cortical excitatory neurons is better described as a continuum, with a few notable exceptions in layers 5 and 6. Dendritic morphologies in layers 2–3 exhibited a trend towards a decreasing width of the dendritic arbor and a smaller tuft with increasing cortical depth. Inter-area differences were most evident in layer 4, where V1 contained more atufted neurons than higher visual areas. Moreover, we discovered neurons in V1 on the border to layer 5 which avoided deeper layers with their dendrites.

          3D electron microscopy ({EM}) has been successful at mapping invertebrate nervous systems, but the approach has been limited to small chunks of mammalian brains. To scale up to larger volumes, we have built a computational pipeline for processing petascale image datasets acquired by serial section {EM}, a popular form of 3D {EM}. The pipeline employs convolutional nets to compute the nonsmooth transformations required to align images of serial sections containing numerous cracks and folds, detect neuronal boundaries, label voxels as axon, dendrite, soma, and other semantic categories, and detect synapses and assign them to presynaptic and postsynaptic segments. The output of neuronal boundary detection is segmented by mean affinity agglomeration with semantic and size constraints. Pipeline operations are implemented by leveraging distributed and cloud computing. Intermediate results of the pipeline are held in cloud storage, and can be effortlessly viewed as images, which aids debugging. We applied the pipeline to create an automated reconstruction of an {EM} image volume spanning four visual cortical areas of a mouse brain. Code for the pipeline is publicly available, as is the reconstructed volume.},

Each modality offers new perspectives on the variation of biological processes underlying cell type specialization. Cellular scale electron microscopy ({EM}) provides dense ultrastructural examination and an unbiased perspective into the subcellular organization of brain cells, including their synaptic connectivity and nanometer scale morphology. It also presents a clear challenge for analysis to identify cell-types in data that contains tens of thousands of neurons, most of which have incomplete reconstructions. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic survey of the somatic region of all cells within a cubic millimeter of cortex using quantitative features obtained from {EM}. This analysis demonstrates a surprising sufficiency of the perisomatic region to identify cell-types, including types defined primarily based on their connectivity patterns. We then describe how this classification facilitates cell type specific connectivity characterization and locating cells with rare connectivity patterns in the dataset.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relationship between circuit connectivity and function is crucial for uncovering how the brain implements computation. In the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), excitatory neurons with similar response properties are more likely to be synaptically connected, but previous studies have been limited to within V1, leaving much unknown about broader connectivity rules. In this study, we leverage the millimeter-scale {MICrONS} dataset to analyze synaptic connectivity and functional properties of individual neurons across cortical layers and areas. Our results reveal that neurons with similar responses are preferentially connected both within and across layers and areas — including feedback connections — suggesting the universality of the ‘like-to-like’ connectivity across the visual hierarchy. Using a validated digital twin model, we separated neuronal tuning into feature (what neurons respond to) and spatial (receptive field location) components. We found that only the feature component predicts fine-scale synaptic connections, beyond what could be explained by the physical proximity of axons and dendrites. We also found a higher-order rule where postsynaptic neuron cohorts downstream of individual presynaptic cells show greater functional similarity than predicted by a pairwise like-to-like rule. Notably, recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) trained on a simple classification task develop connectivity patterns mirroring both pairwise and higher-order rules, with magnitude similar to those in the {MICrONS} data. Lesion studies in these {RNNs} reveal that disrupting ‘like-to-like’ connections has a significantly greater impact on performance compared to lesions of random connections. These findings suggest that these connectivity principles may play a functional role in sensory processing and learning, highlighting shared principles between biological and artificial systems.},

Many systems have been proposed for locating synapses, and recent research has included a way to identify the synaptic partners that communicate at a synaptic cleft. We re-frame the problem of identifying synaptic partners as directly generating the mask of the synaptic partners from a given cleft. We train a convolutional network to perform this task. The network takes the local image context and a binary mask representing a single cleft as input. It is trained to produce two binary output masks: one which labels the voxels of the presynaptic partner within the input image, and another similar labeling for the postsynaptic partner. The cleft mask acts as an attentional gating signal for the network. We ﬁnd that an implementation of this approach performs well on a dataset of mouse somatosensory cortex, and evaluate it as part of a combined system to predict both clefts and connections.},

	abstract = {Combining two-photon calcium imaging (2PCI) and electron microscopy ({EM}) provides arguably the most powerful current approach for connecting function to structure in neural circuits. Recent years have seen dramatic advances in obtaining and processing {CI} and {EM} data separately. In addition, several joint {CI}-{EM} datasets (with {CI} performed in vivo, followed by {EM} reconstruction of the same volume) have been collected. However, no automated analysis tools yet exist that can match each signal extracted from the {CI} data to a cell segment extracted from {EM}; previous eﬀorts have been largely manual and focused on analyzing calcium activity in cell bodies, neglecting potentially rich functional information from axons and dendrites. There are two major roadblocks to solving this matching problem: ﬁrst, dense {EM} reconstruction extracts orders of magnitude more segments than are visible in the corresponding {CI} ﬁeld of view, and second, due to optical constraints and non-uniform brightness of the calcium indicator in each cell, direct matching of {EM} and {CI} spatial components is nontrivial. In this work we develop a pipeline for fusing {CI} and densely-reconstructed {EM} data. We model the observed {CI} data using a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization ({CNMF}) framework, in which segments extracted from the {EM} reconstruction serve to initialize and constrain the spatial components of the matrix factorization. We develop an eﬃcient iterative procedure for solving the resulting combined matching and matrix factorization problem and apply this procedure to joint {CI}-{EM} data from mouse visual cortex. The method recovers hundreds of dendritic components from the {CI} data, visible across multiple functional scans at diﬀerent depths, matched with densely-reconstructed three-dimensional neural segments recovered from the {EM} volume. We publicly release the output of this analysis as a new gold standard dataset that can be used to score algorithms for demixing signals from 2PCI data. Finally, we show that this database can be exploited to (1) learn a mapping from 3d {EM} segmentations to predict the corresponding 2d spatial components estimated from {CI} data, and (2) train a neural network to denoise these estimated spatial components. This neural network denoiser is a stand-alone module that can be dropped in to enhance any existing 2PCI analysis pipeline.},

While considerable work has measured the average connectivity of several interneuron classes, there remains a fundamental lack of understanding of the connectivity distribution of distinct inhibitory cell types with synaptic resolution, how it relates to properties of target cells, and how it affects function. Here, we used large-­scale electron microscopy and functional imaging to address these questions for chandelier cells in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex. With dense reconstructions from electron microscopy, we mapped the complete chandelier input onto 153 pyramidal neurons. We found that synapse number is highly variable across the population and is correlated with several structural features of the target neuron. This variability in the number of axo-a­ xonic {ChC} synapses is higher than the variability seen in perisomatic inhibition. Biophysical simulations show that the observed pattern of axo-a­ xonic inhibition is particularly effective in controlling excitatory output when excitation and inhibition are co-­active. Finally, we measured chandelier cell activity in awake animals using a cell-t­ype-s­ pecific calcium imaging approach and saw highly correlated activity across chandelier cells. In the same experiments, in vivo chandelier population activity correlated with pupil dilation, a proxy for arousal. Together, these results suggest that chandelier cells provide a circuit-­wide signal whose strength is adjusted relative to the properties of target neurons.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the developing brain undergo extensive structural refinement as nascent circuits adopt their mature form. This physical transformation of neurons is facilitated by the engulfment and degradation of axonal branches and synapses by surrounding glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes. However, the small size of phagocytic organelles and the complex, highly ramified morphology of glia have made it difficult to define the contribution of these and other glial cell types to this crucial process. Here, we used large-scale, serial section transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) with computational volume segmentation to reconstruct the complete 3D morphologies of distinct glial types in the mouse visual cortex, providing unprecedented resolution of their morphology and composition. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the fine processes of oligodendrocyte precursor cells ({OPCs}), a population of abundant, highly dynamic glial progenitors, frequently surrounded small branches of axons. Numerous phagosomes and phagolysosomes ({PLs}) containing fragments of axons and vesicular structures were present inside their processes, suggesting that {OPCs} engage in axon pruning. Single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing from the developing mouse cortex revealed that {OPCs} express key phagocytic genes at this stage, as well as neuronal transcripts, consistent with active axon engulfment. Although microglia are thought to be responsible for the majority of synaptic pruning and structural refinement, {PLs} were ten times more abundant in {OPCs} than in microglia at this stage, and these structures were markedly less abundant in newly generated oligodendrocytes, suggesting that {OPCs} contribute substantially to the refinement of neuronal circuits during cortical development.},

Here, we investigated cilia frequency, internal structure, shape, and position in large, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy volumes of mouse primary visual cortex. Cilia extended from the cell bodies of nearly all excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells ({OPCs}), but were absent from oligodendrocytes and microglia. Structural comparisons revealed that the membrane structure at the base of the cilium and the microtubule organization differed between neurons and glia. {OPC} cilia were distinct in that they were the shortest and contained pervasive internal vesicles only occasionally observed in neuron and astrocyte cilia. Investigating cilia-proximal features revealed that many cilia were directly adjacent to synapses, suggesting cilia are well poised to encounter locally released signaling molecules. Cilia proximity to synapses was random, not enriched, in the synapse-rich neuropil. The internal anatomy, including microtubule changes and centriole location, defined key structural features including cilium placement and shape.

Taking a data-driven approach inspired by classical neuroanatomy, we classified inhibitory neurons based on the relative targeting of dendritic compartments and other inhibitory cells and developed a novel classification of excitatory neurons based on the morphological and synaptic input properties. The synaptic connectivity between inhibitory cells revealed a novel class of disinhibitory specialist targeting basket cells, in addition to familiar subclasses. Analysis of the inhibitory connectivity onto excitatory neurons found widespread specificity, with many interneurons exhibiting differential targeting of certain subpopulations spatially intermingled with other potential targets. Inhibitory targeting was organized into “motif groups,” diverse sets of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same excitatory targets. Collectively, our analysis identified new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a foundation for linking modern multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram.},
