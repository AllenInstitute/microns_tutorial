    "The **Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (MICrONS) program**  aimed to close the performance gap between human analysts and automated pattern recognition systems by reverse-engineering the algorithms of the brain. This program mapped the function and connectivity of cortical circuits, using high throughput imaging technologies, with the goal of providing insights into the computational principles that underlie cortical function in order to advance the next generation of machine learning algorithms. \n",

These data include large scale electron microscopy based reconstructions of cortical circuitry from mouse visual cortex, with corresponding functional imaging data from those same neurons. \n",

    "The function of the nervous system arises out of a combination of the properties\n",
    "of individual neurons and the properties of how they are connected into a larger\n",
    "network. The central goal of connectomics is to produce *complete maps* of the\n",
    "*connectivity* of the nervous system with *synaptic resolution* and analyze them\n",
    "to better understand the organization, development, and function of the nervous\n",
    "system. **Electron microscopy (EM)** has been a central tool in achieving these aims\n",
    "for two key reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. EM can easily image nanometer-scale structures such as synapses. This allows one to unambiguously observe chemical synapses and, if pushed to high enough resolution, gap junctions. *(Note that the MICrONs dataset is not high enough resolution to unambiguously observe gap junctions).*\n",
    "2. Dense staining methods allow the complete observation of a of rich collection of cellular features, including membranes, nuclei, mitochondria, and much more. This allows the reconstruction of the complete morphology of cells.\n"

    "## What questions can be addressed by connectomic data?\n",
    "For invertebrates like the fruit fly, the nervous system is highly stereotyped\n",
    "in both the composition of cells and how they connect to one another. Indeed, in\n",
    "the fly many cell types exist as a single pair of cells, one from the left and\n",
    "one from the right hemisphere. Connectomic maps from one individual can thus act\n",
    "as a nearly universal map of the brain and powerfully inform theoretical and\n",
    "experimental studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mouse cortex, this same type of stereotypy does not apply. There is no\n",
    "one-to-one match between any given cell in the brain of one mouse and another,\n",
    "and thousands of cells in a cortical area can belong to the same cell type.\n",
    "Because of this, the types of questions one can ask differ, but dense\n",
    "reconstruction of anatomy and connectivity still can be a powerful source of\n",
    "insight into questions like: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What morphological or connectivity-based cell types can be found?\n",
    "* What are the properties of the excitatory networks in cortex and how might they relate to learning rules?\n",
    "* What rules dictate how inhibitory cells distribute their synaptic output across target cell types?  \n",
    "\n",
    "In some datasets, such as the MICrONs dataset, calcium imaging of the same\n",
    "tissue was performed prior to preparing the structural EM volume.\n",
    "In that case, we can address additional questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   How do functional responses relate to the morphology of cells?\n",
    "*   How do functional responses relate to the connectivity of cells?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, a whole host of non-neuronal cells are also present, such as\n",
    "astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and pericytes. Many people are\n",
    "interested in studying the relationship between these cells and neurons, and\n",
    "connectomic datasets can be a powerful tool to discovery this structural\n",
