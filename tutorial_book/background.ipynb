    "This IARPA MICrONS dataset spans a 1.4mm x .87mm x .84 mm volume of cortex in a P87 mouse. It is 400x larger than the previously released Phase 1 dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.microns-explorer.org/phase1). The dataset was imaged using two-photon microscopy, microCT, and serial electron microscopy, and then reconstructed using a combination of AI and human proofreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional imaging data of an estimated 75,000 pyramidal neurons in the volume contains the single cell responses to a variety of visual stimuli. That same tissue was imaged with high resolution electron microscopy and processed through a machine learning driven reconstruction pipeline to generate a large scale anatomical connectome. The anatomical data contains more than an estimated 200,000 cells, and 120,000 neurons ([details](https://www.microns-explorer.org/manifests/mm3-v117#cell-numbers)). Automated synapse detection measured more than 523 million synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes this dataset remarkable in a few key ways\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was the largest multi-modal connectomics dataset released and the largest connectomics dataset by minimum dimension, number of cells, and number of connections detected (as of releas in July 2021)\n",
    "- It is the first EM reconstruction of a mammalian circuit across multiple functional brain areas.\n",
