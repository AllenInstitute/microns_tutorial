The central goal of connectomics is to produce *complete maps* of the\n*connectivity* of the nervous system with *synaptic resolution* and analyze them\nto better understand the organization, development, and function of the nervous\nsystem. Electron microscopy (EM) has been a central tool in achieving these aims\nfor two key reasons: 1) EM can easily image nanometer-scale structures such as\nsynapses. This allows one to unambiguously observe chemical synapses and, if\npushed to high enough resolution, gap junctions. (Note that the MICrONs dataset\nis not high enough resolution to unambiguously observe gap junctions.) 2) Dense\nstaining methods allow the complete observation of a of rich collection of\ncellular features, including membranes, nuclei, mitochondria, and much more.\nThis allows the reconstruction of the complete morphology of cells.\n\nThe general approach to EM involves staining tissue with heavy metals and using\nelectrons to imaging thin sections of tissue. Sections can either be created by\ncutting tissue into slices (\"serial section\") followed by imaging, or by imaging\nthe face of a block and shaving off a thin layer of tissue after each run\n(\"block face\"). In both approaches, each section corresponds to only 30–50\nnanometers of thickness (although it can be a millimeter wide), and thus\nassembling a substantial volumes involves thousands or tens of thousands of\nsections in a row. Finally, computational methods are used to align and assemble\nthe sections into a single volume and then to segment the volume into individual\ncells and synapses.\n\nWhile the resolution afforded by EM has been used to study the nervous system\nsince 1959, the first true “connectomics” project that merged dense mapping of\nneurons and synaptic connectivity was the study of the nematode *C. elegans* led\nby Sydney Brenner, John White, and others. Advances in EM methods and\ncomputational methods in the last ten years have allowed tremendous scaling of\nconnectomics datasets. The largest current mammalian datasets, including the\nMICrONs volume will consider here, now span more than a cubic millimeter, and\ninvertebrate datasets now can cover the entire brain of a fruit fly.\n\n## What questions can be addressed by connectomic data?\nFor invertebrates like the fruit fly, the nervous system is highly stereotyped\nin both the composition of cells and how they connect to one another.

Connectomic maps from one individual can thus act\nas a nearly universal map of the brain and powerfully inform theoretical and\nexperimental studies.\n\nIn mouse cortex, this same type of stereotypy does not apply. There is no\none-to-one match between any given cell in the brain of one mouse and another,\nand thousands of cells in a cortical area can belong to the same cell type.\nBecause of this, the types of questions one can ask differ, but dense\nreconstruction of anatomy and connectivity still can be a powerful source of\ninsight into questions like: \n\n* What morphological or connectivity-based cell types can be found?\n* What are the properties of the excitatory networks in cortex and how might they relate to learning rules?\n* What rules dictate how inhibitory cells distribute their synaptic output across target cell types?  \n\nIn some datasets, such as the MICrONs dataset, calcium imaging of the same\ntissue was performed prior to preparing the structural EM volume.\nIn that case, we can address additional questions like:\n\n*   How do functional responses relate to the morphology of cells?\n*   How do functional responses relate to the connectivity of cells?\n\nIn addition, a whole host of non-neuronal cells are also present, such as\nastrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and pericytes.
