If present, this column will be the same as `id` |\n| `created_ref` / `valid_ref` / `id_ref` (optional) | For reference tables, the data shows both the created/valid/id of the reference annotation and the target annotation.

This was applied to most cells in the dataset that had complete cell bodies (e.g. not cut off by the edge of the data).

This was applied to many cells in the dataset, but required more data than soma and nucleus features alone and thus more cells did not complete the pipeline. It has very good performance on excitatory vs inhibitory neurons because it focuses on dendritic spines, a characteristic property of excitatory neurons. It is a good table to double check E/I classifications if in doubt.\n\nThe key columns are:\n\n| Column | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `id` | Soma ID for the cell |\n| `pt_position` \\ `pt_supervoxel_id` \\ `pt_root_id` | Bound spatial point columns associated with the centroid of the cell nucleus |\n| `classification-system`| `baylor_log_reg_cell_type_coarse` for all entries |\n| `cell_type` | `excitatory` or `inhibitory` |\n\n: Baylor Dendrite Feature Table {.light .hover}\n\n### Fine prediction from dendritic features\n\nTable name: `allen_column_mtypes_v1`\n\nThis table contains all neurons within a well-proofread 100 micron square column\nin primary visual cortex (VISp) spanning all layers. \n\nExcitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons were distinguished manually, and subclasses were assigned based on a data-driven clustering of the neuronal features. Inhibitory neurons were classified based on how they distributed they synaptic outputs onto target cells, while exictatory neurons were classified based on a collection of dendritic features. \n\nFor more details, see the section on the [minnie column](../em_03_proofreading.html#minnie-column) or read the\npreprint [@schneider-mizell2023]. \n\nNote that all cell type labels in this column come from a clustering specific to this paper, and while they are intended to align with the broader literature they are not a direct mapping or a well-established convention. \n\nFor a more conventional set of labels on the same set of cells, look at the table `allen_v1_column_types_slanted_ref`.

This table is well-verified, but contains fewer {term}`ROI`s (N=12,052 root ids, 13,925 ROIs).\n* `apl_functional_coreg_forward_v5` : The results of automated functional matching between the EM and 2-p functional data.

It has very good performance on excitatory vs inhibitory neurons because it focuses on dendritic spines, a characteristic property of excitatory neurons. It is a good table to double check E/I classifications if in doubt.\n\nThe key columns are:\n\n| Column | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `id` | Soma ID for the cell |\n| `pt_position` \\ `pt_supervoxel_id` \\ `pt_root_id` | Bound spatial point columns associated with the centroid of the cell nucleus |\n| `classification-system`| `baylor_log_reg_cell_type_coarse` for all entries |\n| `cell_type` | `excitatory` or `inhibitory` |\n\n: Baylor Dendrite Feature Table {.light .hover}\n\n### Fine prediction from dendritic features\n\nTable name: `allen_column_mtypes_v1`\n\nThis table contains all neurons within a well-proofread 100 micron square column\nin primary visual cortex (VISp) spanning all layers. \n\nExcitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons were distinguished manually, and subclasses were assigned based on a data-driven clustering of the neuronal features. Inhibitory neurons were classified based on how they distributed they synaptic outputs onto target cells, while exictatory neurons were classified based on a collection of dendritic features. \n\nFor more details, see the section on the [minnie column](../em_03_proofreading.html#minnie-column) or read the\npreprint [@schneider-mizell2023]. \n\nNote that all cell type labels in this column come from a clustering specific to this paper, and while they are intended to align with the broader literature they are not a direct mapping or a well-established convention. \n\nFor a more conventional set of labels on the same set of cells, look at the table `allen_v1_column_types_slanted_ref`. Cell types in that table align with those in `aibs_soma_nuc_metamodel_preds_v117` above.\n\nThe key columns are:\n\n| Column | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `id` | Soma ID for the cell |\n| `pt_position` \\ `pt_supervoxel_id` \\ `pt_root_id` | Bound spatial point columns associated with the centroid of the cell nucleus |\n| `classification-system`| `excitatory` or `inhibitory` |\n| `cell_type` | One of several cell types, detailed below |\n\n: Column M-type Table {.light .hover}\n\nThe cell types in the table are:\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=true}\n\n### M-type Cell Type definitions\n\n| Cell Type | Subclass | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `L2a` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 2 (upper layer 2/3) excitatory neurons | \n| `L2b` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 2 (upper layer 2/3) excitatory neurons | \n| `L3a` | Excitatory | A cluster of excitatory neurons transitioning between upper and lower layer 2/3 | \n| `L3b` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 3 (upper layer 2/3) excitatory neurons | \n| `L3c` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 3 (upper layer 2/3) excitatory neurons | \n| `L4a` | Excitatory | The largest cluster of layer 4 excitatory neurons | \n| `L4b` | Excitatory | Another cluster of layer 4 excitatory neurons | \n| `L4c` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 4 excitatory neurons along the border with layer 5 | \n| `L5a` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 5 IT neurons at the top of layer 5 | \n| `L5b` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 5 IT neurons throughout layer 5 | \n| `L5ET` | Excitatory | The cluster of layer 5 ET neurons | \n| `L5NP` | Excitatory | The cluster of layer 5 NP neurons | \n| `L6a` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 6 IT neurons at the top of layer 6 | \n| `L6b` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 6 IT neurons throughout layer 6. *Note that this is different than the label \"Layer 6b\" which refers to a narrow band at the border between layer 6 and white matter* | \n| `L6c` | Excitatory | A cluster of tall layer 6 cells (unsure if IT or CT) | \n| `L6CT` | Excitatory | A cluster of tall layer 6 cells matching manual CT labels | \n| `L6wm` | Excitatory | A cluster of layer 6 cells along the border with white matter | \n| `PTC` | Inhibitory | Perisomatic targeting cells, a cluster of inhibitory neurons that target the soma and proximal dendrites of excitatory neurons.

One of the three categories described above |\n| `status_axon` | The status of the axon proofreading. One of the three categories described above |\n\n: Proofreading Status Table {.light .hover}\n\n## Functional Coregistration Tables\n\nTo relate the structural data to functional data, cell bodies must be coregistered between the functional imaging and EM volumes.\nThe results of this coregistration are stored in two tables with the same columns:\n\n* `coregistration_manual_v3` : The results of manually verified coregistration. This table is well-verified, but contains fewer {term}`ROI`s (N=12,052 root ids, 13,925 ROIs).\n* `apl_functional_coreg_forward_v5` : The results of automated functional matching between the EM and 2-p functional data. This table is not manually verified, but contains more {term}`ROI`s (N=36,078 root ids, 68,873 ROIs).\n\nPlease see the [Functional Data](../functional_tutorial/functional_intro.html) section for more information about using this data.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## repair link\n:::\n\nThe column descriptions are:\n\n| Column | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `id` | Soma ID for the cell |\n| `pt_position` \\ `pt_supervoxel_id` \\ `pt_root_id` | Bound spatial point columns associated with the centroid of the cell nucleus |\n| `session`| The session index from functional imaging |\n| `scan_idx` | The scan index from functional imaging |\n| `unit_id` | The functional unit index from imaging.
