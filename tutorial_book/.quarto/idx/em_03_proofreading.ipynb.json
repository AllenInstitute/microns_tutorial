While split errors reduce the number of correct synaptic connections, merge errors add incorrect connections.\n\nThe frequency of errors is roughly related to the size of the process, and thus axons and dendrites have extremely different error profiles.\nBecause they are thicker, dendrites are largely well-segmented, with only a few split errors and most merge errors being with small axons rather than other dendrites.\n\nEven without proofreading a neuron's dendrites, we thus expect that most of the input synapses onto the dendrites are correct (since the vast majority of merge errors are with axons that only have output synapses), though some may be missing due to split errors at tips or missing dendritic spines.\n\nIn contrast, axons, because they are thinner, have many more errors of both kinds.\nWe thus do not trust axonal connectivity at all without additional proofreading.\n\nProofreading is not an all-or-nothing process.\nBecause of the reasons described above, we distinguish between the proofread status of the axon and the dendrite for each neuron separately.\nIn addition, we consider three levels of proofreading:\n\n* **Unproofread**: The arbor (dendrite or axon) has not been comprehensively proofread, although edits may have happened here and there.\n* **Clean**: The arbor (dendrite or axon) has been comprehensively proofread to remove all merge errors, but may still have split errors. This means that the synapses that are there are correct, but incomplete.\n* **Extended**: The arbor (dendrite or axon) has been comprehensively proofread to remove all merge and split errors. This means that the synapses that are there are correct and as-complete-as-possible by expert proofreaders. Note that even a well-proofread neuron often has some tips that cannot be followed due to the limitations of the underlying imagery, and of course processes may leave the segmented volume.\n\nThe upshot is that unproofread axons are not of a quality suitable for analysis, you can trust the targets of a clean or extended axon because the default dendrite quality is good.\nHowever, if your analysis truly demands knowing if a particular neuron is connected to another neuron or not (rather than connecting to a population), the proofreading standards are particularly high and possibly require additional checks.\n\n| Pre Axon Status | Post Dendrite Status | Analyzability |\n|:---| :---| :---| \n| Unproofread | Unproofread | Not analyzable |\n| Unproofread | Clean / Extended | Not analyzable |\n| Clean | Unproofread / Clean / Extended | Analyzable but connectivity could be highly biased by limited axonal extent |\n| Extended | Unproofread | Analyzable and connectivity is close to complete |\n\n: Proofreading status {.light .hover}\n\nSince a single proofread axon can have many hundreds to ten thousand synaptic outputs, the vast majority onto local dendrites, each single axon provides a tremendous amount of data about that cell's postsynaptic targets.\n\n## Proofreading efforts\nThere have been several different proofreading efforts in the MICrONS data with different goals and levels of comprehensiveness.\nImportantly, neurons were not selected for proofreading randomly, but rather chosen based on various criteria.\nA few of the most signifcant proofreading efforts are described below.\n\n* Excitatory neuron proofreading for functional connectomics.
