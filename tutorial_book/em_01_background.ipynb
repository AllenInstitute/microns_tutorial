    "## Background\n",
    "The function of the nervous system arises out of a combination of the properties\n",
    "of individual neurons and the properties of how they are connected into a larger\n",
    "network. The central goal of connectomics is to produce *complete maps* of the\n",
    "*connectivity* of the nervous system with *synaptic resolution* and analyze them\n",
    "to better understand the organization, development, and function of the nervous\n",
    "system. Electron microscopy (EM) has been a central tool in achieving these aims\n",
    "for two key reasons: 1) EM can easily image nanometer-scale structures such as\n",
    "synapses. This allows one to unambiguously observe chemical synapses and, if\n",
    "pushed to high enough resolution, gap junctions. (Note that the MICrONs dataset\n",
    "is not high enough resolution to unambiguously observe gap junctions.) 2) Dense\n",
    "staining methods allow the complete observation of a of rich collection of\n",
    "cellular features, including membranes, nuclei, mitochondria, and much more.\n",
    "This allows the reconstruction of the complete morphology of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach to EM involves staining tissue with heavy metals and using\n",
    "electrons to imaging thin sections of tissue. Sections can either be created by\n",
    "cutting tissue into slices (\"serial section\") followed by imaging, or by imaging\n",
    "the face of a block and shaving off a thin layer of tissue after each run\n",
    "(\"block face\"). In both approaches, each section corresponds to only 30–50\n",
    "nanometers of thickness (although it can be a millimeter wide), and thus\n",
    "assembling a substantial volumes involves thousands or tens of thousands of\n",
    "sections in a row. Finally, computational methods are used to align and assemble\n",
    "the sections into a single volume and then to segment the volume into individual\n",
    "cells and synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the resolution afforded by EM has been used to study the nervous system\n",
    "since 1959, the first true “connectomics” project that merged dense mapping of\n",
    "neurons and synaptic connectivity was the study of the nematode *C. elegans* led\n",
    "by Sydney Brenner, John White, and others. Advances in EM methods and\n",
    "computational methods in the last ten years have allowed tremendous scaling of\n",
    "connectomics datasets. The largest current mammalian datasets, including the\n",
    "MICrONs volume will consider here, now span more than a cubic millimeter, and\n",
    "invertebrate datasets now can cover the entire brain of a fruit fly."

    "## What questions can be addressed by connectomic datasets?\n",
    "For invertebrates like the fruit fly, the nervous system is highly stereotyped\n",
    "in both the composition of cells and how they connect to one another. Indeed, in\n",
    "the fly many cell types exist as a single pair of cells, one from the left and\n",
    "one from the right hemisphere. Connectomic maps from one individual can thus act\n",
    "as a nearly universal map of the brain and powerfully inform theoretical and\n",
    "experimental studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mouse cortex, this same type of stereotypy does not apply. There is no\n",
    "one-to-one match between any given cell in the brain of one mouse and another,\n",
    "and thousands of cells in a cortical area can belong to the same cell type.\n",
    "Because of this, the types of questions one can ask differ, but dense\n",
    "reconstruction of anatomy and connectivity still can be a powerful source of\n",
    "insight into questions like: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What morphological or connectivity-based cell types can be found?\n",
    "* What are the properties of the excitatory networks in cortex and how might they relate to learning rules?\n",
    "* What rules dictate how inhibitory cells distribute their synaptic output across target cell types?  \n",
    "\n",
    "In some datasets, such as the MICrONs dataset, calcium imaging of the same\n",
    "tissue was performed prior to preparing the structural EM volume.\n",
    "In that case, we can address additional questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   How do functional responses relate to the morphology of cells?\n",
    "*   How do functional responses relate to the connectivity of cells?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, a whole host of non-neuronal cells are also present, such as\n",
    "astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and pericytes. Many people are\n",
    "interested in studying the relationship between these cells and neurons, and\n",
    "connectomic datasets can be a powerful tool to discovery this structural\n",
    "context."
