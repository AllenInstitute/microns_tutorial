    "## How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Submit a Request__\n",
    "\n",
    "Members of the scientific community submits a short request for information they believe might be contained within this dataset, but might require some work to extract. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " * proofreading axons and dendrites for a specific group of neurons\n",
    " * annotating the locations of dense core vesicles in these particular cells\n",
    " * annotating locations where microglia have engulfed synapses\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Develop a Plan__\n",
    "\n",
    "A scientist at the Allen Institute will work with you on developing a plan that helps address the scientific question you are interested in, including any manual proofreading and annotation work that needs to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plans will be designed to maximize impact across all requests when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Plan Execution__\n",
    "\n",
    "A Scientific Steering Group will evaluate all the plans and prioritize the manual work based upon the resources available to the virtual observatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plans will then be carried out by staff of the virtual observatory, with no costs to the requestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "__4. Data Sharing__\n",
    "\n",
    "The data produced from the efforts of the manual proofreaders is then shared with the entire scientific community for everyone to benefit from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data releases will occur at least quarterly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sharing Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Data created by the Vortex project, such a proofreading and annotations, will be integrated into broader publicly available dataset for everyone to use. Proofreading updates the segmentation, which will be released along with any other changes that are part of the centralized dataset, no matter their source. Annotations will be made on the dataset and released as tables via the CAVEclient, and periodically as static file dumps available via google cloud. See the specific dataset pages for details on data access.\n",
