    "## Proofreading categories\n",
    "Proofreading is not an all-or-nothing process.\n",
    "Because of the reasons described above, we distinguish between the proofread status of the axon and the dendrite for each neuron separately.\n",
    "In addition, we consider three levels of proofreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unproofread**: The arbor (dendrite or axon) has not been comprehensively proofread, although edits may have happened here and there.\n",
    "* **Clean**: The arbor (dendrite or axon) has been comprehensively proofread to remove all merge errors, but may still have split errors. This means that the synapses that are there are correct, but incomplete.\n",
    "* **Extended**: The arbor (dendrite or axon) has been comprehensively proofread to remove all merge and split errors. This means that the synapses that are there are correct and as-complete-as-possible by expert proofreaders. Note that even a well-proofread neuron often has some tips that cannot be followed due to the limitations of the underlying imagery, and of course processes may leave the segmented volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot is that unproofread axons are not of a quality suitable for analysis, you can trust the targets of a clean or extended axon because the default dendrite quality is good.\n",
    "However, if your analysis truly demands knowing if a particular neuron is connected to another neuron or not (rather than connecting to a population), the proofreading standards are particularly high and possibly require additional checks."
