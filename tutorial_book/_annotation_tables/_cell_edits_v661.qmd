Table name: `cell_edits_v661`

A count of how many proofreading edits were made to each cell, one entry for every nucleus that had a valid id, calculated at v661.

The key columns of are:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `id` | Soma ID for the cell |
| `pt_position` \ `pt_supervoxel_id` \ `pt_root_id` | Bound spatial point columns associated with the centroid of the nucleus |
| `group_id` | The number of edits at v661 |

: Cell edit at v661 {.light .hover}

This is a reference table on `nucleus_detection_v0`, and can be indexed by the same nucleus id.
