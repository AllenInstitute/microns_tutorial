Table name: `aibs_column_nonneuronal`

A subset of nucleus detections in a 100 um column (n=2204) in VISp were manually classified by anatomists at the Allen Institute into categories of cell subclasses, first distinguishing cells into classes of non-neuronal, excitatory and inhibitory; then into subclasses.

For the neuronal subclasses, see `allen_v1_column_types_slanted_ref`

The key columns are:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `id` | Soma ID for the cell |
| `pt_position` \ `pt_supervoxel_id` \ `pt_root_id` | Bound spatial point columns associated with the centroid of the cell nucleus |
| `classification-system`| One of `aibs_coarse_excitatory` or `aibs_coarse_inhibitory` for detected neurons, or `aibs_coarse_nonneuronal` for non-neurons (glia/pericytes).
| `cell_type` | One of several cell types, detailed below |
