Table name: `aibs_column_nonneuronal`

A subset of nucleus detections in a 100 um column (n=2204) in VISp were manually classified by anatomists at the Allen Institute into categories of cell subclasses, first distinguishing cells into classes of non-neuronal, excitatory and inhibitory; then into subclasses.

For the neuronal subclasses, see `allen_v1_column_types_slanted_ref`

## Deprecated table
This table remains available from materialization versions: 343

It is recommended to use `aibs_column_nonneuronal_ref` instead, which indexes on a consistent `nucleus_id`
