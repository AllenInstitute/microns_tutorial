Table name: `allen_v1_column_types_slanted`

A subset of nucleus detections in a 100 um column (n=2204) in VISp were manually classified by anatomists at the Allen Institute into categories of cell subclasses, first distinguishing cells into classes of non-neuronal, excitatory and inhibitory; then into subclasses.

For the non-neuronal subclasses, see `aibs_column_nonneuronal_ref`

::: {.callout-warning}
## Deprecated table
This table remains available from materialization versions: 343

It is recommended to use `allen_v1_column_types_slanted_ref` instead, which indexes on a consistent `nucleus_id`
