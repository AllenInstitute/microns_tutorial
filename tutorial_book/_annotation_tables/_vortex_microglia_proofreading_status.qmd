Table name: `vortex_microglia_proofreading_status`

Manual screening and proofreading of microglia within the V1 column, as part of the as part of the [VORTEX project](../vortex-overview.html).

The key columns are:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pt_position` \ `pt_supervoxel_id` \ `pt_root_id` | Bound spatial point columns associated with the centroid of the cell nucleus. |
| `status`| One of 'non' indicating no cleaning or extension; 'clean' indicating neurite and non-microglia elements have been manually removed and the substantive processes attached; 'extended' meaning all endpoints of the microglia evaluated and extended. |
| `valid_id` | The root id of the microglia when it the proofreading assessment was made. |
