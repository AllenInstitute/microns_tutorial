Table name: `vortex_astrocyte_proofreading_status`

Manual screening and proofreading of astrocytes as part of the as part of the [VORTEX project](../vortex-overview.html).

The key columns are:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `id` | Soma ID for the cell |
| `pt_position` \ `pt_supervoxel_id` \ `pt_root_id` | Bound spatial point columns associated with the centroid of the cell nucleus |
| `status`| One of 'non' indicating no cleaning or extension; 'clean' indicating neurite and non-astrocytic elements have been manually removed; 'extended' meaning astrocytic processes within the volume of the astrocyte have been comprehensively reviewed and assigned to the most likely cell |
| `valid_id` | The root id of the astrocyte when it the proofreading assessment was made |
