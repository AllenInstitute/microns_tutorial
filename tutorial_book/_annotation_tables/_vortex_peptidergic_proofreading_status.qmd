Table name: `vortex_peptidergic_proofreading_status`

This table reports the status of a manually selected subset of putative neuromodulatory axons, distinguished by boutons with large secretory vesicles. Labeled as part of the as part of the [VORTEX project](../vortex-overview.html).



The key columns are:

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `id` | Soma ID for the cell |
| `pt_position` \ `pt_supervoxel_id` \ `pt_root_id` | Bound spatial point columns associated with a representative point of axon |
| `status`| One of 'non' indicating no cleaning or extension; 'clean' indicating synapses can be trusted but may not be complete; 'extended' meaning all end points visited and extended to completion |
| `valid_id` | The root id of the axon when it the proofreading assessment was made |

::: {.callout-tip}
Axons in this table that are complete and `extended` are also posted to `proofreading_status_and_strategy` with strategy: `axon_fully_extended` and `dendrite_none`.
